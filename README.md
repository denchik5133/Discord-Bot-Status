# Discord Bot Status

## Description
This script is for Garry's Mod (GMod) and is written in Lua. It updates the Discord-bot status with server information,
including the current number of players online and server details. The bot automatically updates the message at specified intervals and tracks records for the number of players.

## Installation

1. Place the script in a Lua file on your Garry's Mod server, for example in `discord_bot_status/lua/autorun/server/discord_bot_status.lua`.
2. Make sure you have the required dependencies and a valid Discord-bot token.
3. Set up a `config` table with your bot token, guild ID and channel ID.
4. Run the script in the GMod environment to start sending updates. The bot will send updates every 60 seconds by default.

## Utilisation

- The script requires your bot to have the appropriate permissions on the Discord server.
